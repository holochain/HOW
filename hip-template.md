## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Copyright

Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Motivation

Clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that this HIP solves. Include specific use cases and describe why this HIP is valuable to the Holochain ecosystem.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Rationale

Provide a rationale for the proposed changes. Explain how the proposed changes will fulfill the motivation and solve the problem described in the Abstract.

## Reference Implementation

An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.
