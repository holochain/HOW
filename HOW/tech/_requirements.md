## Technical Specification

The technical specification MUST describe the syntax and semantics of any new standard. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Safety Considerations (optional)

An optional section that describes any Data Integrity, Security, or Privacy concerns that pertain to the standard.  (Note about precise definitions of Integrity/Security/Privacy)

## Reference Implementation (optional)

An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.

## Backwards Compatibility Analysis

When the standard either obsoletes or is a new version of a previous standard, this section that describes backward compatibility MUST be added.
